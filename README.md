# Movie-Recommendation-App
Implemented a website that recommends/filters out movies based on content.This however doesn't include collaborative or hybrid based filtering.
Downloaded the dataset online and then preprocessed the data and then further vectorized the tags of  every movie and calculated cosine distance between them to recommend movies based on most common tags you're searching for or the other movies similiar to that movie/caste/genre.
